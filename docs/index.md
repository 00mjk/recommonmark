Recommonmark
============

A `docutils`-compatibility bridge to [CommonMark][cm].

This allows you to write CommonMark inside of Docutils & Sphinx projects.

Contents
--------
* [API Reference](api_ref.md)
* [AutoStructify Component](auto_structify.md)

Getting Started
---------------
This document is actually generated by recommonmark, and its source code can be used as a good reference.

[AutoStructify Component](auto_structify.md) provides a lot of additional features beyond markdown,
including reference generation, syntax hightlight and math formula.

Why a bridge?
-------------

Many python tools (mostly for documentation creation) rely on `docutils`.
But [docutils][dc] only supports a ReStructuredText syntax.

For instance [this issue][sphinx-issue] and [this StackOverflow
question][so-question] show that there is an interest in allowing `docutils`
to use markdown as an alternative syntax.

## Why another bridge to docutils?

recommonmark uses the [python implementation][pcm] of [CommonMark][cm] while
[remarkdown][rmd] implements a stand-alone parser leveraging [parsley][prs].

Both output a [`docutils` document tree][dc] and provide scripts
that leverage `docutils` for generation of different types of documents.

Acknowledgement
---------------

recommonmark is mainly derived from [remarkdown][rmd] by Steve Genoud and
leverages the python CommonMark implementation.

It was originally created by [Luca Barbato][lu-zero],
and is now maintained in the Read the Docs (rtfd) GitHub organization.
